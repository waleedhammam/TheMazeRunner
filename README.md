#TheMazeRunner
AI Project designed as maze solver that solve any maze and send the points to the goal to a robot

###code design 
the code is designed to solve complex mazes and send the solution to the robot controller in easy format 

###search Algorithm 
we used A-star Algorithm to get the shortest path

###Robot consideration 
we took into account the robot dimentions and maze cell long to make the robot walk freely without crashing any inner objects or maze borders

###Data communication 
we used serial communication to send the final path to the robot
